    "Background: A research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, is collecting data about how people play video games. They have set up a MineCraft server where players' in-game actions are recordered as they navigate through the world.These data allow researchers to study player behavior in a naturalistic online environment, with the goal of understanding how players engage with the game and what factors drive deeper participation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the collected dataset, we aim to address a set of broad research questions. One practical challenge the team faced is the need to target recruitment effectively and ensure enough resources to handle the number of players they attract. Among 3 broad questions, we focus on the following:"

    "## Methods\n",
    "To answer this question we decided to use K-nearest neighbours classification to predict whether or not a player was subscribed using player age and experience. This method is appropriate because we can turn player experience into quantitative variables using the natural ascending order, and it is unlikely from our initial exploration that there will be a linear association between the explanatory and response variables. There are also very little assumptions required, only that distance between points is correlated to their similarity, which makes this method easy to apply here. It is possible that as we increase training data the algorithm may slow down, and may not be applicable outside the range of our explanatory variables. But since the amount of observations is not too high, and our explanatory variables have natural boundaries (lifespan and preset categories) that prevent us from having to predict outside of our range, these weaknesses of K-nearest neighbours classification should not limit the validity of our results. However, one weakness that may affect the results is the importance of having equal number of observations for each category of the variable that is going to be predicted. This is important because having an inequal amount would naturally cause the majority category to outvote the minority category near the decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning the data of null values, fixing the colunm names, and turning the subscribe and experience column into variables that the algorithm can work with, we set the seed for reproducibility purposes. We then split the data into testing and training subsets. Training took up 80% of the data, and the rest was used as testing to later evaluate the effectiveness our algorithm. Exploratory graphs of the experience, age, and subscription columns were created, showing no clear linear relation between any of the variables. RMSPE was then used to optimize the number of neighbours (K) with 10 fold cross validations and 5 repeats on the training subset. We selected the number of nearest neighbors based on when the accuracy estimate for each k-value roughly stopped improving. The algorithm was then evaluated using the testing subset, to produce an accuracy estimate for the model. A confusion matrix was also used to get a more comprehensive view of performance."

    "The results show that the K-nearest neighbors classification algorithm returned roughly 0.5 and 0.575 accuracy estimates for using just age and experience respectively. However, using both variables returned an accuracy estimate of 0.75 for 11 neighbors, which is a significant improvement. Model 3 also has a relatively high precision value of 0.7436, which shows that our model will return similar results even without a set seed. Some flaws with this model are that it almost always predicts that a player is subscribed (TRUE), and often the errors result from when the player is actually not subscribed. This is mainly due to the disproportionate nature of the subscribe variable sample, since TRUE values take up 73.196%, and it would be interesting to see how the model would perform in a more balanced dataset with more observations.
